## Introduction

Analyse employee attrition details to enhance organization's ability to attract, retain, nurture top talent and engaged workforce with more productive environment.

## Tools

- Power Bi Desktop -> [Download](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-in/desktop/)

## Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) Process
In this project, ETL process involved the following key steps:

### Data Extraction
- Extract and download HR attrition data as .csv file provided by @MeriSKILL during internship.

### Data Transformation

+ Data Cleaning
    - Handling missing values.
    - Removing duplicate and unnecessary values..
    - Standardizing or formatting data types for each column as per required.

+ Data Preprocessing
    - create new column using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), conditional column formatting as per requirement.
    - create new measure for calculation such as attrition count, active employee, etc.
    - create data groups for analysing and better outcomes. for example: age group, salary slab, eyc.

### Data Loading
- Loaded the transformed data into the Power BI environment for analysis and dashboard creation.

## Data Visualization
Performed various data visualization techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the HR Employee Attrition data. The visualizations created during the process include:

- Line charts to visualize monthly income, attrition by job role.
- bar charts. 
- Progress chart using donut charts.
- Stacked column and stacked bar charts.
- advance cards to display KPI values. 
- pie charts, column charts.
- Page Navigation Action feature to navigate between different report page. use *ctrl + click* to navigate. I have applied the action on Images (Overview Page) and Back button "â‡¦" on other page. kindly, check above demo video for better understanding.
